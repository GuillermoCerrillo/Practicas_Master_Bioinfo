This script reads a TSV file, pulls genus names from the second column (ignoring the header), normalizes them to the first space‑separated token, and prints a sorted unique list.​


For each line of infile after the first (data lines only):
	Extract the value from column 2.
	From this value, take only the substring before the first space (the first word).
	Collect all such extracted words.
	Sort the list of words alphabetically.
	Remove duplicate entries, keeping only unique genus names.
	Save output to genera.txt.
