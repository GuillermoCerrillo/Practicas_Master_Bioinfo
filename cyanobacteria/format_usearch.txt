This script takes a genus and changes its format to that of usearch

Input: a string depicting a genus (i.e. Escherichia)

Processing:
	Set the url (setting the genus to lowercase)
	(example: url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/escherichia)
	Crawl the webpage to get the family, order and class it belongs to.
	(domain Will always be Prokaryota and kingdom will always be Bacteria)
	Echo the format: >tax=d:Prokaryota,k:Bacteria,p:Phylum,c:Class,o:Order,f:Family,g:Genus; to the output file.
	(example: >tax=d:Prokaryota,k:Bacteria,p:Pseudomonadota,c:Class,o:Enterobacterales,f:Enterobacteriaceae,g:Escherichia;)

Yes, I am aware that the taxonomic denomination in LPSN for E. coli is no Domain = Bacteria and Kingndom = Pseudomonadati. This format is deliberatedly chosen to work with older databases.

This porcessed is looped for all genera in the file.
