This script reads a list of genera and, for each one, tries to download an associated FASTA file from LPSN into a local fasta/ folder.​


Inputs and setup
	Take one command‑line argument input_file, which is a text file containing one genus 	name per line.
	Create a directory named fasta if it does not already exist.


Main loop over genera
	For each line in input_file:
		Read the line into variable genus.
		If genus is empty, skip to the next line.
		Construct the URL to the LPSN genus page:
			Convert genus to lowercase.
			Set url = "https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/<genus_lowercase>".
		Print a message indicating that this genus is being checked.


Fetch page and detect FASTA link
	Download the HTML of url into a variable page using an HTTP GET request.
	Search page for a hyperlink whose href attribute contains the substring "fasta":
		Extract the first matching href path and store it in fasta_path.
	If fasta_path is non‑empty:
		Print that a FASTA was found for this genus.
		Download the file at "https://lpsn.dsmz.de" + fasta_path and save it as fasta/<genus>.fasta (with the genus name exactly as in the input line).
		Print that the file was successfully saved.
	Else (no FASTA link found in the HTML):
		Print that no FASTA is available for this genus.


End of processing
	Continue until all lines (all genera) in input_file have been processed.
	Exit after the loop finishes, leaving all successfully downloaded FASTA files in the fasta/ directory.
